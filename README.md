Nochat
=====

Nochat is an experimental project that can run some VRChat prefabs with the Unity Editor in VR, without the VRChat SDK installed.

Since UdonSharp is just a subset of C#, VRChat prefabs can be repurposed into plain Unity OpenXR prefabs,
without needing a single line of executable code from VRChat.

*Not only VR runs in-editor, regular code debugging tools can be used, including [hot reloading](https://hotreload.net/). There is no Udon involved.*
